Event,Begin Date,End Date,Deaths,CPI-Adjusted Estimated Cost (In Billions),Summary
Western Drought and Heatwave June 2021,1/1/2021,6/30/2021,138,TBD,"Western drought expands and intensifies across many western states. A historic heat wave developed for many days across the Pacific Northwest shattering numerous all-time high temperature records across the region. This prolonged heat dome was maximized over the states of Oregon and Washington and also extended well into Canada. These extreme temperatures impacted several major cities and millions of people. For example, Portland reached a high of 116 degrees F while Seattle reached 108 degrees F. The count for heat-related fatalities is still preliminary and will likely rise further. This combined drought and heat is rapidly drying out vegetation across the West, impacting agriculture and contributing to increased Western wildfire potential and severity."

Temperature departures exceeding 40.0 degrees F (22.2 degrees C) below normal occurred from Nebraska southward to Texas. The prolonged arctic air caused widespread power outages in Texas, as well as other southern states, with multiple days of sustained below-freezing temperatures. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were without power. Additional impacts were frozen water pipes, which burst upon thawing causing water damage to buildings. These extreme conditions also caused or contributed to the deaths of more than 125 people in Texas alone, and this number is expected to increase further, after additional reporting. There were also snow and ice impacts across numerous states including Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.

These wildfires spread rapidly and destroyed several small towns in California, Oregon and Washington. Colorado also had a severe wildfire season, as its three largest wildfires on record burned during 2020. Dense wildfire smoke also produced hazardous air quality that affected millions of people that also included major cities for weeks. Hundreds of additional wildfires also burned across other Western states."
