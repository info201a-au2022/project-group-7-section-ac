As we were testing and learning about the different countries, we realized that every country has one or two types of disaster that are much more prevalent than others. For example, if the statistics of the United States are filtered, we can see that there are many more storms compared to that of any other disaster with the jump being from about 600 to 100. This is different for Afghanistan though because when Afghanistan is filtered we can see that the top disaster is flood at 96 and then the other closest one is with an amount of 31. "),
    p("The second thing we learned is that some states are hit by natural disasters much more often than other states. This comes to show with our first graph and that if clicked, something like Alaska will have much more declared disasters than something like Wyoming. This makes sense when you take into account location. The location, however, is not always the case. For a state like Colorado, which is located near the same area as Wyoming, it has many more disasters declared and can be compared to those states that are near water or are in an area that people think should have more disasters than others."),
    p("The last takeaway is that floods have been the most common in the December to February in Washington. Something we also noticed about our graph was that the x-axis was ordered by month as opposed to year which gives us a better understanding of how the disasters may have a certain pattern during a certain time of year. If we filter flood for the third graph, we can see that the months from December to February are much more popular in terms of floods happening. With that, we can also see other patterns for the state of Washington such as storms, which also has a similar timeframe of occurance.")

With this project we have learned that there are a lot of disasters and that based on our data, the amount of disaster does not vary based on location. Of course we think location has a factor in the types of disasters but in terms of raw statistical data, the amount of disasters that happen is not patterned and we could not find a pattern for location and amount of disasters declared. In our summary takeaways page on the shiny app, we can see that the state of Colorado has many more disasters than that of the state of Alaska. This comes to show that the location of a state does not matter when it comes to natural disasters. There is no way we can predict which disasters will happen where with this data but there is a chance that someone who is viewing our website will be able to detect the risk factor of each state to see which states are safer from disasters than others."),

There is however a way to detect risk level of each state in the United States as well as countries given the data that we have worked with. With this project, we think that a key takeaway should be that the amount of disasters that happen are not patterned but the type of disaster itself would vary from location to location. We would like our audience to leave knowing that the data in this project is nothing professional and people should not take it as official knowledge that is going to benefit them.
