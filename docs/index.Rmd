```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/dynamic_summary.R")

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(bp)
```

This length encoding plot shows the leading 7 declared disasters in the US since 1953. It can be seen that Hurricanes and Floods are the leading disasters with a declaration amount of 8764, and 9317, respectively. The other sections include droughts, fires, ice, snow, and tornadoes. This plot is useful because it visually shows the gap there is in the amount of times certain disasters happen.

```{r echo=FALSE}

```
