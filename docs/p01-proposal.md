## Abstract  
Our main question is how much impact do natural disasters have over different things in the world? This is important because we should understand which type of natural disasters affect the world and in what areas they tend to happen in. To address this question, we will be creating different types of graphs that will show us what disasters have what effect where. 
## Keywords  
Natural disaster, Environment, Safety, Health, Crop Production, Food Quality
## Introduction  
Our project will include creating a website that will have links to take you to different pages within the website which will then have different types of interactable graphs. The graphs will contain different effects natural disasters have on the world such as crop production, climate change, and malnutrition. We will be using R to code the website and create different graphs and interactable menu items to test out the effects of natural disasters. This will help us dictate which disasters are the most dangerous to humans and what we create. We will be using different data sets to gather the information and put them together to create all the graphs together. This will take some cross-referencing from the different datasets.

#### **Project Framing**

#### **Human Values**
Two important human values regarding natural disasters would be safety and environmental stability. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, mudslides, and tsunamis have all caused infrastructural damage, injuries, and deaths over time. It’s important to understand what actions we can take to best protect ourselves in these situations. Environmental stability is another human value that’s important because natural disasters can have severe impacts across the globe. For example, earthquakes, tornados, and tsunamis can all negatively impact things like farmland, crop production, and ultimately food quality.

#### **Direct and Indirect Stakeholders**
A direct stakeholder when it comes to this project focused on natural disasters would be an environmental scientist who uses the data we have organized in order to gain intel and then use it for decisions made in the future. An indirect stakeholder regarding natural disasters would be people/communities who are informed by government officials or environmental scientists on whether to relocate or take safety precautions in order to prepare for oncoming disasters. 

#### **Possible Harms and Benefits**
The only true harm we see with our project is if the data we collect is inaccurate since it would lead to people making wrong decisions and interpretations. There are many benefits to our project. People would be more informed about safety when it comes to natural disasters. People would be more informed about how much natural disasters affect things like health, crop production, and food quality. Knowledge is key and we believe this project could help many realize the hazards we face and how we can be better prepared to deal with them in the future. This information could help to start a political movement in order to address important topics such as having better emergency procedures in certain locations and safer infrastructure developments.

## Research Questions  
Our first research question is “How do natural disasters affect crop production?” This question will let us know what effects natural disasters will have on crop production. This is motivated because we have been thinking about how production would affect the demand of certain crops which will lead us to the next section on the project: “How does crop production affect the prices of food in the world?” This sways well into the second question because it will tell us indirectly how natural disasters would affect the food costs as well. This is motivated by the constant changing of prices in food. We want to be able to tell if and when the food prices change and if natural disasters have any effect on the price of food. Our third question is: “How does crop production affect malnutrition in certain countries?” This question deals with the natural disasters’ effects on crop production. This is motivated by the data sets we have found and we thought it would be interesting to do a comparison between the two data sets and how one thing could lead to another. 

## The Dataset  

## Expected Limitations  
Implications for people who choose to use our website will be that they can be able to look at the data and create ideas for what to do if a certain natural disaster happens. It will also assist them in trying to focus on a certain disaster over another. Using our graphs and data, they will be able to dictate which disasters they should create policies for, such as food pricing, or for a designer how to create buildings in the area for a certain type of disaster if they are more prone to it. We think our graphs and data will help to create a sense of urgency and preparation needed for certain groups of individuals. 

## Limitations  
Our limitations consist of any coding that we may not learn how to do over the course of the quarter. Limitations will also be if we cannot find any data sets to support our research questions well enough. For example, if there is something we have not learned to code in, then we would not be able to add it to the website despite our understanding and ideas for the topic. This will limit us to only create what we know how to create in terms of the website and the graphs.
